            On this website, we will explain our final Integrated Learning Project (ILP), where we organized a bazaar
            and art performance that took place on January 14th and 16th, 2025, at Saint Ursula Jakarta Middle School.
            <strong>results of these will be explained on this website.</strong> The theme for this year’s ILP is Nusantara which is
            adapted to the name Puspanusa for this event. <strong>The diversity of Indonesia’s culture is reflected in
            Puspanusa.</strong> As part of the theme, our group decided to choose Java, <strong>specifically East Java is chosen as our
            main theme.</strong> With that, we named our stall “Javest,” short for “Java Feast and Festival”. East Java is a
            beautiful province with a rich culture, natural beauty, and amazing traditions. Through this project, we all
            learn more about our country’s cultural heritage and use our creativity to combine our cultural heritage
            with the modern era.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Batik crafts, cute accessories, and delicious and unique food and drinks are featured in our stall. As a
            token of appreciation, freebies were given out to the customer by us. East Java-like ornaments are used to
            decorate our booth.</strong> Examples are the night delicious flower (bunga sedap malam) and our mascots which are
            the animals from Indonesia. We learn during the bazaar that opening a stall or shop is harder than it looks.
            We need to use our creativity, budgeting skills, fast critical thinking, etc. During the bazaar, it was also
            very crowded, and we needed to think and act fast while also promoting. We didn’t expect most of our items
            to sell out so fast, while others are hard to sell. Good thing everything sold out in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the bazaar, there was also an art performance where <strong>collaboration with another group was done
            by us.</strong> The art performance we chose is a drama musical about a teenage friendship that has a
            miscommunication with one another. We chose this topic so the audiences, especially those of the same age as
            us, can relate to it. The story tells us about the importance of communication between friends and not
            framing others for amusement. <strong>Popular nostalgic Indonesian songs were incorporated into the drama musical,
            one of which is Laskar Pelangi.</strong> Not only that, but also we incorporated dancing choreography, funny, and
            magical scenes, making the drama more interesting.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the whole process, there were lots of <strong>obstacles like coming up with ideas, communication
            challenges, time management, figuring out how to make the product and preparing for the drama musical, and
            many more had to be faced. Different roles and responsibilities were given to the members to ensure a
            successful and faster outcome.</strong> But even with that, it’s still difficult to balance it out. There were also a
            few conflicts in our group because of different opinions. It was a very stressful and exhausting journey.
            But despite all of the hardships, <strong>valuable lessons were taught, such as teamwork, making decisions, dealing
            with rejection, being confident, and many more.</strong> It also helps to enhance my marketing, sewing,
            communication, time management, and cooking skills. With that, this Integrated Learning Project overall
            makes us grow stronger, wiser when doing something, more creative, and more critical.
